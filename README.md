# üöó **Project-Dead_Reckoning_Robot** ü§ñ

This project demonstrates a **self-autonomous robot** that uses **dead-reckoning** as its primary localization technique. By leveraging **speed, distance**, and **time**, the robot estimates its position and navigates in an environment. It's powered by an **ESP32** microcontroller and equipped with a **VL53L0X** distance sensor, all working together to build a **probabilistic mapping system**.

## üìú **Project Overview**

This project aims to create an interactive and real-time mapping system for a robot, utilizing probabilistic methods to track its position and surroundings. By combining the **ESP32 microcontroller** and **VL53L0X sensor**, we use the **log-odds** probability technique to generate an **interactive environment map**. The robot's journey is visualized in real-time on a grid, giving users full control and insight into its movements and mapped surroundings.
